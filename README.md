<h3> Web Scraping</h3>
<p>Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting information from websites. This is usually done by writing a script or using a specialized software tool to access the HTML code of a webpage and extract the desired data from the web pages. Web scraping can be used for a variety of purposes, such as collecting data for research, monitoring competitors, prices, or gathering information from multiple sources. Remember that while web scraping can be a powerful tool for collecting data, it's important to use it responsibly and ethically, respecting the terms of service of the websites you scrape and avoiding any actions that could cause harm or disruption.</p>
